This is a bot for receiving proposals for changes in discord, or a gameserver you are running.
I have written the first issue of the bot in danish since i run a danish server. 

The bot works by waiting for the command "forslag" which means proposal in danish. To activate the command you need a "!" before the command. The message is then saved and deleted from the proposal channel. This is done because I have personally experince a lot of debate on the channel if the proposal is controverial. Instead the message is delete and sent with a ping to a admin channel.
